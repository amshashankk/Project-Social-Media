 ## [Validator Package](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-playground/validator/v10@v10.9.0#section-readme)


### Package validator implements value validations for structs and individual fields based on tags.

It has the following unique features:

Cross Field and Cross Struct validations by using validation tags or custom validators.
Slice, Array and Map diving, which allows any or all levels of a multidimensional field to be validated.
Ability to dive into both map keys and values for validation
Handles type interface by determining it's underlying type prior to validation.
Handles custom field types such as sql driver Valuer see Valuer
Alias validation tags, which allows for mapping of several validations to a single tag for easier defining of validations on structs
Extraction of custom defined Field Name e.g. can specify to extract the JSON name while validating and have it available in the resulting FieldError
Customizable i18n aware error messages.
